# React Photos of Animals!

## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

This project was created using React. What this project does is take images that are put into an image folder and shows them on the front page. There is a like button added to have people who view the website like all the cute animals!
There is also a little description that shows up when you click on the pictures!

I would like to thank Prime Digital Academy for giving me the oppurtunity to work on this project!
